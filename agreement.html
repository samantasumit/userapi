        <p>
            <strong>Recitals</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Haulcat provides a mobile app and web-based technology platform that connects customers, retail stores, and restaurants,
            with independent contractors to facilitate on-demand delivery services (the " Haulcat Platform" or "Platform").
            Through the Haulcat Platform customers may request that merchandise or food be delivered to them from particular
            retail locations or restaurants. Independent Contractors can access the Haulcat Platform and receive Delivery
            Opportunities (as defined in section 3A. below). Haulcat is not a retail store, restaurant, food delivery service,
            merchandise delivery service, or food preparation entity.</p>
        <p>Contractor is a fully-licensed, independent provider of delivery services, authorized to conduct the delivery services
            contemplated by this Agreement in the geographic location(s) in which Contractor operates. Contractor is in lawful
            possession of all equipment (including a motor vehicle or bicycle, if applicable) necessary to perform the delivery
            services contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with all applicable laws. Contractor desires to enter into
            this Agreement for the right to access the Haulcat Platform to receive delivery opportunities made available
            through the Platform. When performing services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Contractor understands
            and expressly agrees that Contractor is not doing so as an employee of Haulcat, any Merchant, or customer. Contractor
            understands Contractor is free to select those times Contractor wishes to be available on the Haulcat Platform
            to receive delivery opportunities and to select only those deliveries Contractor wishes to select.</p>
        <p>In consideration of the above recitals and the mutual promises below, and for other good and valuable consideration,
            Haulcat and Contractor (collectively "the Parties") agree as follows:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Purpose of Agreement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1A. This Agreement governs the entire relationship between Haulcat and Contractor, and establishes the Parties' respective
            rights and obligations applicable to the "Delivery Opportunities" (as defined in Section 3A below) made available
            to Contractor through the Platform. In exchange for the promises contained in this Agreement, Contractor shall
            have the contractual right and obligation to perform those Delivery Opportunities that Contractor accepts ("Deliveries",
            defined in Section 3A below). However, except as expressly stated in Section 12, "Term and Termination," below,
            nothing in this Agreement requires Contractor to perform any particular Delivery during the Term of this Agreement,
            and nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee Contractor any particular volume of Delivery Opportunities or Deliveries
            for any particular time period.</p>
        <p>1B. Per the terms of this Agreement, Contractor shall be contractually bound to complete the Deliveries in accordance
            with any specifications provided by the customer and/or Merchant (as defined in Section 3A below).</p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Contractor's Services</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2A. Contractor agrees and represents that Contractor is an independent provider of delivery services, and that Contractor
            satisfies all legal requirements necessary to perform the services contemplated by this Agreement. As an independent
            contractor, Contractor shall be solely responsible for determining how to lawfully perform Deliveries.</p>
        <p>2B. Contractor agrees to fully perform all Deliveries accepted in a timely, efficient, safe and lawful manner. Haulcat
            shall have no right to, and shall not, supervise, direct or control Contractor, or control the manner or prescribe
            the method Contractor uses to perform Deliveries, and the general public and all governmental agencies regulating
            the activities contemplated by this Agreement shall be so informed. Contractor shall be solely responsible for
            determining the most effective, efficient, satisfactory, and safe manner to perform Deliveries, including determining
            the manner of pickup, delivery, and route selection. The Parties acknowledge and agree that those provisions
            of the Agreement reserving ultimate authority in Haulcat have been inserted solely to achieve compliance with
            federal, state, or local laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof and/or to ensure the safety of the Platform
            for all users.</p>
        <p>2C. Contractor expressly acknowledges and agrees that as a separately established provider of delivery services,
            Contractor retains the right to perform services for others and to hold itself out to the general public as a
            separately established provider of delivery services. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Contractor or Haulcat
            from engaging in similar arrangements or business with others. Haulcat neither has nor reserves the right to
            restrict Contractor at any time from performing delivery services for other entities, or customers, even should
            such business directly compete with Haulcat. Provided Contractor can meet the customer's specifications, and
            unless prohibited by law, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Contractor from carrying and/or delivering
            goods for other(s) of Contractor's customers at the same time while delivering orders requested by customers
            through the Haulcat Platform. Similarly, Contractor is not limited in any way from being actively logged onto
            online platforms other than the Haulcat Platform while actively logged onto the Haulcat Platform, subject only
            to the limitation that Contractor's use of other online platforms may not prevent Contractor's ability to timely,
            efficiently and safely complete any Deliveries Contractor has accepted through the Haulcat Platform.</p>
        <p>2D. Contractor is not required to purchase, lease, or rent any products, equipment, or services from Haulcat as a
            condition of doing business with Haulcat or entering into this Agreement.</p>
        <p>2E. Contractor agrees that to ensure the safety of the Haulcat Platform, Haulcat shall require that Contractor submit
            to and pass a background check before Contractor receives access to the Haulcat Platform or is given continued
            access to the Platform. Additionally, , Contractor agrees that, in accordance with applicable law and at Haulcat'
            sole discretion, periodically during the term of this Agreement (as defined in Section 12 below) Haulcat may
            require that Contractor submit to and pass additional background check(s). Haulcat agrees that any such check(s)
            may be conducted only with Contractor's consent (as applicable) and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
        <p>2F. On occasion, Haulcat may offer Contractor different promotions or referral programs. Contractor agrees not to
            abuse or manipulate the referral programs or promotions. Contractor understands that any abuse or manipulation
            constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may lead to deactivation.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Deliveries</strong>
        </p>
        <p>3A. While Contractor is actively logged onto the Haulcat Platform, the Platform will, from time to time, notify Contractor
            of the opportunity to complete deliveries from restaurants or retail stores to customers as ordered by customers
            through the Platform (each, a "Delivery Opportunity"). With respect to each Delivery Opportunity accepted by
            Contractor (a "Delivery"), Contractor agrees to retrieve the order from restaurants and/or retail locations,
            (collectively "Merchants") and deliver the order to customers in a timely fashion. Contractor understands that
            the customer, not Haulcat, determines the content of the Delivery. Contractor understands that Haulcat shall
            have no right to, and shall not, supervise, direct, or control the manner or prescribe the method Contractor
            uses to perform the Delivery. Contractor understands and agrees that the parameters of each Delivery are established
            by the customer, not Haulcat, and represent the end result desired, not the means by which Contractor is to accomplish
            the end result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3B. Contractor agrees that Haulcat has discretion regarding which, if any, Delivery Opportunities to offer Contractor,
            just as Contractor has the discretion whether and to what extent to accept any Delivery Opportunity.</p>
        <p>3C. Contractor agrees that if Contractor accepts a Delivery Opportunity that includes alcohol, Contractor is solely
            responsible for ensuring that the Delivery complies with all federal, state, and local laws, including but not
            limited to ensuring that the individual accepting the delivery is the individual who placed the order, has provided
            valid identification, is 21 years old or older, and is not intoxicated.</p>
        <p>3D. Contractor agrees that Haulcat may provide Contractor with a prepaid debit card that Contractor will use to complete
            certain Deliveries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any unauthorized use of this prepaid
            debit card will be considered theft and/or fraud, and may lead to deactivation of Contractor's account. If Contractor
            loses the prepaid debit card, Contractor will report the loss to Haulcat immediately.</p>
        <p>3E. Contractor authorizes Haulcat, during the course of a Delivery, to communicate with Contractor, customer and/or
            Merchant to assist Contractor, to the extent permitted by Contractor, in facilitating deliveries. However, under
            no circumstances shall Haulcat be authorized to control the manner or means by which Contractor performs a Delivery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3F. In the event Contractor fails to fully perform any Delivery due to Contractor's action or omission (a "Service
            Failure"), Haulcat reserves the right to recover any costs incurred by Haulcat related to the Service Failure.
            If Contractor fails to complete a return of any item that cannot be delivered (a "Return Failure"), Haulcat reserves
            the right to recover any costs incurred by Haulcat related to the Return Failure. If Contractor disputes responsibility
            for a Service Failure or Return Failure, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the "Payment Disputes" provision
            in Section 5 below.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>4. Delivery Fees</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4A. Contractor agrees to receive a delivery fee paid through the Haulcat Platform in exchange for each Delivery completed.
            Haulcat agrees to use its best efforts to establish delivery fees for each locality and time slot that will maximize
            the Delivery Opportunities available to Contractor. Contractor will receive notice of how delivery fees are calculated
            prior to accepting Delivery. Contractor understands that delivery fees paid through the Platform may vary depending
            on customer demand. Haulcat may, but is not obligated to, offer Contractor additional incentives to complete
            particular Delivery Opportunities.</p>
        <p>4B. Haulcat agrees to transmit delivery fees to Contractor via direct deposit no later than seven (7) days after
            Contractor successfully completes the related Delivery through the Platform. Contractor is responsible for any
            applicable processing fees associated with such remittance.</p>
        <p>4C. Nothing in this Section 4 is intended to limit the Parties' ability during the Term of this Agreement (as defined
            in Section 12 below) to mutually agree to a payment structure different than that described herein.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. Payment Disputes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5A. Contractor's Failure: In the event there is a Service Failure, Contractor may forfeit all or a portion of the
            fee relating to that Delivery (depending on the extent of the performance failure). Any reduction in the delivery
            fee shall be based upon proof provided by the customer, Merchant, Contractor, and any other party with information
            relevant to the dispute. Haulcat shall make the initial determination as to whether a Service Failure was the
            result of Contractor's action/omission and, if so, what percentage of fault Contractor shall bear (and, therefore,
            what percentage of the delivery fee Contractor shall be paid). Contractor shall have the right to challenge Haulcat'
            determination as described in the provisions set forth in Sections 11 and 12, below.</p>
        <p>5B. Haulcat' Failure: In the event Haulcat fails to remit payment of delivery fees in a timely or accurate manner,
            Contractor shall have the right to seek proper payment by any legal means contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
            however, Contractor first informs Haulcat in writing of the failure and provides a reasonable opportunity to
            cure it.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. Contractor's Equipment</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6A. Contractor certifies that Contractor has all equipment, including motor vehicles, scooters and bicycles, when
            applicable ("Equipment") necessary to perform Deliveries. When Contractor uses a vehicle or scooter to perform
            a Delivery, Contractor is solely responsible for ensuring that the vehicle or scooter used conforms to all vehicle
            laws pertaining to safety, equipment, inspection, and operational capability.</p>
        <p>6B. Contractor is responsible for all costs and expenses arising from Contractor's performance of Deliveries, including,
            but not limited to, traffic tickets, tolls, parking fees, inspections, and any other costs related to Equipment.
            Except as otherwise required by law, Contractor assumes all risk of damage or loss to its Equipment.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. Relationship of Parties</strong>
        </p>
        <p>7A. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between independent businesses that are separately owned
            and operated. The Parties intend this Agreement to create the relationship of principal and independent Contractor
            and not that of employer and employee. The Parties are not employees, agents, joint venturers or partners of
            each other for any purpose. Neither party shall have the right to bind the other by contract or otherwise except
            as specifically provided in this Agreement.</p>
        <p>7B. For a Contractor who earns the minimum income established by the Internal Revenue Service, Haulcat shall report
            all payments made to Contractor on a calendar year basis using an applicable IRS Form 1099. Contractor agrees
            to report all such payments to the appropriate federal, state, and local taxing authorities.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>8. Insurance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8A. As a condition of doing business with Haulcat, and at Contractor's own expense, Contractor shall, during the
            Term of this Agreement (as defined in Section 12 below), maintain current insurance of the types and in the amounts
            required by law in the jurisdiction in which Contractor operates to perform Contractor's services as contemplated
            by this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicle insurance that satisfies the minimum vehicle
            insurance coverage amounts and types required by state or local law. Haulcat may offer Contractor the opportunity
            to participate in certain group insurance plans made available by third party providers to delivery service providers
            like Contractor who use the Haulcat Platform. However, Contractor is under no obligation to participate in such
            plans.</p>
        <p>8B. Contractor is solely responsible for conducting the appropriate research and consultation necessary to determine
            the insurance types and amounts Contractor must maintain. Contractor acknowledges that Contractor's failure to
            secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage, including but not limited to vehicle insurance if applicable,
            shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in the termination of the Agreement, the
            loss of Contractor's right to receive Delivery Opportunities, and deactivation of the Contractor's account on
            the Haulcat Platform.</p>
        <p>8C. Workers' Compensation/Occupational Accident Insurance: Contractor agrees that Contractor will not be eligible
            for workers' compensation benefits through Haulcat, and instead, will be responsible for providing Contractor's
            own workers' compensation insurance or occupational accident insurance, if permitted by law.</p>
        <p>8D. Notification of Coverage: Contractor agrees to deliver to Haulcat, upon request, current certificates of insurance
            as proof of coverage. Contractor agrees to make available updated certificates each time Contractor purchases,
            renews, or alters Contractor's insurance coverage. Contractor agrees to give Haulcat at least thirty (30) days'
            prior written notice before cancellation of any insurance policy required by this Agreement. Haulcat reserves
            the right to require Contractor to identify Haulcat as an additional insured on Contractor's vehicle insurance.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>9. Indemnity</strong>
        </p>
        <p>9A. Contractor agrees to indemnify, protect, and hold harmless Haulcat, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or
            affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors,
            agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees, from any and all claims, demands, damages, lawsuits, losses,
            liabilities and causes of action arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of or in connection with, the
            actions of Contractor arising from the performance of Deliveries under this Agreement, including but not limited
            to, personal injury to or death of any person (including Contractor), as well as any liability arising from Contractor's
            failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Contractor's obligations hereunder shall include the cost
            of defense, including attorneys' fees, as well as the payment of any final judgment rendered against or settlement
            agreed upon by Haulcat or its parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies.
        </p>
        <p>9B.Contractor agrees to indemnify, protect, and hold harmless Haulcat, including all parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated
            companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents,
            representatives, attorneys, and employees from any and all tax liabilities and responsibilities for payment of
            all federal, state, and local taxes, including, but not limited to all payroll taxes, self-employment taxes,
            workers' compensation premiums, and any contributions imposed or required under federal, state, and/or local
            laws, that are owed by Contractor with respect to Contractor's providing delivery services through the Haulcat
            Platform.</p>
        <p>9C. Contractor agrees to be responsible for, indemnify, and hold harmless Haulcat, including all parent, subsidiary,
            and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their past and present successors, assigns, officers, owners,
            directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees from all costs of Contractor's business, including,
            but not limited to, the expense and responsibility for any and all applicable insurance, local, state, and/or
            federal licenses, permits, taxes, and assessments of any and all regulatory agencies, boards or municipalities.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>10. Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10A. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to this Agreement or
            otherwise arising from the relationship between Contractor and Haulcat, the Parties mutually agree to first attempt
            to negotiate any dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration proceeding.
            Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice of any dispute by either Party. Contractor's address
            for such notices is Contractor's most recent address on file with Haulcat as provided by Contractor. Haulcat'
            address for such notices is the&nbsp;Fleet Help Center.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>11. Mutual Arbitration Provision</strong>
        </p>
        <p>11A. Arbitration of Disputes. Haulcat and Contractor mutually agree to resolve any disputes between them exclusively
            through final and binding arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Haulcat and Contractor expressly agree that this Mutual Arbitration Provision is governed exclusively by the
                Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16) ("FAA") and shall apply to any and all claims between
                the Parties, including but not limited to those arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Contractor's
                classification as an independent Contractor, Contractor's provision of services under this Agreement, the
                delivery fees received by Contractor for performing Deliveries, the termination of this Agreement, the deactivation
                of Contractor's account and all other aspects of the Contractor's relationship with Haulcat, past or present,
                whether arising under federal, state, or local law, including without limitation harassment, discrimination,
                and/or retaliation claims and claims arising under or related to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (or its state
                or local equivalents), Americans with Disabilities Act (or its state or local equivalents), Age Discrimination
                in Employment Act (or its state or local equivalents), Family Medical Leave Act (or its state or local equivalents),
                Fair Labor Standards Act (or its state or local equivalents), state and local wage and hour laws, state and
                local statutes or regulations addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal, state,
                and/or local claims arising out of or relating to the Contractor's relationship or termination of that relationship
                with Haulcat. The Parties expressly agree that this Agreement shall be governed by the FAA even in the event
                Contractor and/or Haulcat are otherwise exempted from the FAA. Any disputes in this regard shall be resolved
                exclusively by an arbitrator. In the event, but only in the event, the arbitrator determines the FAA does
                not apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which the Contractor performs services
                shall apply.</li>
            <li>Only an arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority
                to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this
                Mutual Arbitration Provision. However, as stated in Section 11B.iv below, the preceding clause shall not
                apply to the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>11B. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM AS DESCRIBED HEREIN THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AGREE THAT
                ALL SUCH DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY WAY OF A COURT
                OR JURY TRIAL.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If either party wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via
                certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period.
                This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration, (2) a
                statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought. Any demand
                for arbitration by Contractor must be delivered to Haulcat Attn: Legal Department@haulcat.com</li>
            <li>CLASS ACTION WAIVER&mdash;PLEASE READ.&nbsp;Haulcat and Contractor mutually agree that any and all disputes or
                claims between the parties will be resolved in individual arbitration. The Parties further agree that by
                entering into this Agreement, they waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated
                as a class and/or collective action, or to participate in any class and/or collective action, and an arbitrator
                shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class and/or collective action ("Class Action Waiver").</li>
            <li>REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER&mdash;PLEASE READ.&nbsp;Haulcat and Contractor mutually agree that any and all disputes
                or claims between the Parties will be resolved in individual arbitration. The Parties further agree that
                by entering into this Agreement, they waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated
                as a representative action, or to participate in any representative action, and an arbitrator shall not have
                any authority to arbitrate a representative action ("Representative Action Waiver").</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, this Mutual Arbitration Provision, or the American
                Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules"), any claim that all or part of this Class
                Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall
                be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. As stated above, all other
                disputes regarding interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Mutual Arbitration
                Provision shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator.</li>
            <li>Contractor agrees and acknowledges that entering into this Mutual Arbitration Provision does not change Contractor's
                status as an independent Contractor in fact and in law. Contractor further agrees that when performing Services
                pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Contractor is not doing so as an employee of Haulcat, a Merchant,
                or a customer. Contractor further agrees that any disputes in this regard shall be determined exclusively
                by an arbitrator.
            </li>
            <li>Any arbitration shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except as follows: (1) The arbitration shall be heard by
                one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall be an attorney with experience
                in the law underlying the dispute; (2) Haulcat shall pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees and costs,
                unless applicable law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding applicable law to the contrary, Haulcat shall pay
                the arbitrator's and arbitration fees and costs related to any payment dispute (see Section 5, above); (3)
                The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties) allowing the Parties to conduct discovery
                sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration
                that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes; (4) Except as provided
                in the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award all remedies to which
                a party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall
                not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims
                presented in arbitration. The arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is
                applicable; (5) The arbitrator may hear motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment and will apply
                the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions; (6) The arbitrator's decision
                or award shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law; (7) Either Haulcat or Contractor
                may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief on the ground
                that without such relief the arbitration provided in this Section 11 may be rendered ineffectual.</li>
            <li>Regardless of any other terms of this Agreement, nothing prevents Contractor from making a report to or filing
                a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities
                Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and
                nothing in this Agreement or Mutual Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency
                of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Mutual Arbitration Provision. This Mutual Arbitration
                Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies
                based on the claims addressed in this Section 11, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Mutual
                Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Mutual Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a party from satisfying
                any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law or as required under
                this Agreement before bringing a claim in arbitration. Haulcat will not retaliate against Contractor for
                filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others)
                under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.&nbsp;</li>

                <strong>Right to Opt Out of Arbitration. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of Contractor's contractual relationship
                    with Haulcat, and therefore Contractor may submit a statement notifying Haulcat that Contractor wishes
                    to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision.</strong>In order to opt out, Contractor must notify
                Haulcat of Contractor's intention to opt out by filling out and submitting this&nbsp;Opt-Out Form&nbsp;stating
                Contractor's first and last name, email address, home address, and intention to opt out&nbsp;
                <strong>or</strong>&nbsp;by submitting a signed and dated statement on an "Opt Out Form" that can be obtained from
                and returned to Haulcat at Attn: legaldepartment@haulcat.com
                <strong>or</strong>&nbsp;by submitting to Haulcat at Attn: Legaldepartment@haulcat.com, a written notice stating
                that you are opting out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision. In order to be effective, Contractor's opt-out
                notice must be provided&nbsp;
                <strong>within thirty (30)</strong>&nbsp;days of Contractor's digital execution of this Agreement. If Contractor
                opts out as provided in this subparagraph, Contractor will not be subject to any adverse action as a consequence
                of that decision and may pursue available legal remedies without regard to this Mutual Arbitration Provision.
                If Contractor does not opt out within thirty (30) days of Contractor's execution of this Agreement, Contractor's
                failure to do so shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of this Mutual Arbitration Provision by
                Haulcat and Contractor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contractor's decision to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Provision will relieve Contractor only of Contractor's
            obligation to arbitrate the disputes specified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision, and does not relieve Contractor
            of any obligation to arbitrate disputes not specified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision that might arise under
            any Haulcat Terms of Service to which Contractor may be bound as a customer. Similarly, Contractor's decision
            to opt out of another arbitration provision contained in any other agreement shall not relieve Contractor's obligation
            to arbitrate disputes pursuant to this Mutual Arbitration Provision.</p>
        <p>Contractor acknowledges and agrees that if Haulcat modifies any provision of this Agreement other than this Mutual
            Arbitration Provision, Contractor will not have a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration. Contractor further
            acknowledges and agrees that if Haulcat modifies the addresses for delivery or electronic mailing of opt-out
            or other notices identified in this Mutual Arbitration Provision, Contractor will not have a renewed opportunity
            to opt of arbitration. If, however, Haulcat modifies any provision of this Mutual Arbitration Provision other
            than the addresses for delivery or electronic mailing of opt-out or other notices, Contractor will have a renewed
            opportunity to opt out of arbitration. In such circumstances, the 30-day opt out period will begin to run upon
            Contractor's digital execution of the modified Agreement. Changes to any information referenced at hyperlinks
            from the Agreement or Mutual Arbitration Provision shall not create a renewed opportunity to opt-out.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right To Consult With An Attorney: Contractor has the right to consult with private counsel of Contractor's choice,
                at Contractor's own expense, with respect to any aspect of, or any claim that may be subject to this Mutual
                Arbitration Provision.
            </li>
            <li>In the event any portion of this Mutual Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this
                Mutual Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class,
                collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of
                the Class Action Waiver and/or Representative Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, the class, collective,
                or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but
                the portion of the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver that is valid and enforceable shall
                be enforced in arbitration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>12. Term and Termination of Agreement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>12A. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a term of one (1) year from the date it is accepted
            by Contractor and may not be terminated early without penalty except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon the mutual written consent of the Parties hereto (with electronic communication satisfying this requirement),
                with the mutually agreed-upon termination date stated in the written notice.</li>
            <li>By Haulcat, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Contractor, if Contractor has not performed a delivery for
                a period of at least four (4) months (with electronic communication satisfying this requirement), with the
                date of transmission commencing the thirty (30) day period.</li>
            <li>By Haulcat, in the event of an anticipated change in control or cessation of its operations in Contractor's market,
                upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Contractor (with electronic communication satisfying this requirement),
                with the date of transmission commencing the thirty (30) day period.</li>
            <li>If one party has materially breached the Agreement, immediately upon written notice to the breaching party (with
                electronic communication satisfying this requirement), with such notice specifying the breach relied upon.
                In the case of a material breach by Contractor, and upon written notice, Haulcat may deactivate Contractor's
                account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>12B. The following acts and/or occurrences shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Failure by Contractor to maintain current insurance coverage in the amounts and types specified herein or as
                required by law.</li>
            <li>Failure by Haulcat to remit to Contractor all delivery fees for completed Deliveries within twenty-one (21) days
                of the customer's payment.</li>
            <li>Failure by Contractor to maintain the minimum customer star rating applicable in Contractor's market as of the
                date Contractor accepts this agreement.</li>
            <li>Failure by Contractor to complete a Delivery without waiver of the obligation by the customer or Haulcat.</li>
            <li>Failure by Contractor to maintain all licenses, permits, authorities, registrations and/or other prerequisites
                to operate that are required by law and/or this Agreement.</li>
            <li>Any act by a Party that causes the other party to violate its obligations under any applicable state, federal
                or local law.
            </li>
            <li>Documented complaint by a customer, employee of Haulcat, or employee of a Merchant that Contractor has engaged
                in conduct that a reasonable person would find physically threatening, highly offensive or harassing.</li>
            <li>Documented illegal or destructive acts, including but not limited to fraud or theft, engaged in by Contractor.</li>
            <li>Failure by Contractor to provide services in a manner consistent with Haulcat' effective operation of the Haulcat
                Platform.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>12C. Early termination of this Agreement by Haulcat without proper notice (as established in subsection A above)
            shall result in liquidated damages of $100.00 for each day that notice is not properly provided to Contractor,
            up to a maximum amount of $500.00. The Parties acknowledge that liquidated damages are appropriate because actual
            damages are not reasonably ascertainable.
        </p>
        <p>12D. A party that receives notice of termination must continue to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for
            the entire notice period. Failure to perform shall constitute early termination and shall subject the party to
            the liquidated damages provision in subparagraph C above. By executing this Agreement, Contractor agrees that
            any liquidated damages assessed against it may be deducted from any amount Contractor is owed in delivery fees,
            unless otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
        <p>12E. Other than for failure to maintain the minimum customer star rating, or illegal or destructive acts, in the
            event Contractor disputes that he or she materially breached this Agreement, Contractor may challenge Haulcat'
            decision using the Dispute Resolution process described in Section 11, above. In all such instances, the parties
            will be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs, subject to any remedy to which they may be entitled
            under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but Haulcat shall bear the Arbitrator's
            and arbitration fees and costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as set forth below, Contractor is not precluded
            from asserting that applicable law requires Haulcat to bear the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees and costs,
            even for failure to maintain the minimum customer star rating, or illegal or destructive acts. In the event there
            is a dispute in this regard, the Arbitrator must determine the appropriate apportionment of fees at the earliest
            practicable time following commencement of the arbitration.</p>
        <p>12F. If not terminated, the Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms, unless terminated
            by either party as described in Sections 12A and 12B.</p>
        <p>12G. Contractor's and Haulcat' obligations and rights arising under Section 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and
            14 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement and deactivation of Contractor's account.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>13. Entire Agreement, Transferability, and Waiver</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13A.This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the
            subject matter of this Agreement and shall not be modified, altered, changed or amended in any respect, unless
            in writing and executed by both Parties. This Agreement supersedes any prior contract between the Parties. To
            the extent Haulcat' Terms of Service Agreement (as may be periodically updated) is inconsistent or conflicts
            with this Agreement, this Agreement controls. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without written
            consent of the other and shall be binding upon the Parties hereto, including their heirs and successors, provided,
            however, that Haulcat may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate of Haulcat or
            any successor(s) to its business and/or purchaser of all or substantially all of its stock or assets. References
            in this Agreement to Haulcat shall be deemed to include such successor(s).</p>
        <p>13B. The failure of Haulcat or Contractor in any instance to insist upon a strict performance of the terms of this
            Agreement or to exercise any option herein, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such term
            or option and such term or option shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>14. Miscellaneous</strong>
        </p>
        <p>14A. No Services Required. Nothing in this Agreement requires a Contractor to provide any services. Contractor may
            cease accepting Delivery Opportunities at any time without providing Haulcat notice of Contractor's intention
            to stop performing services.
        </p>
        <p>14B. Captions. Captions appearing in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not in any way limit, amplify,
            modify, or otherwise affect the terms and provisions of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>14C. Savings Clause. Except as provided in Section 11, if any part of this Agreement is declared unlawful or unenforceable,
            the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>14D. Force Majeure. The performance of the obligations of this Agreement on the part of either Haulcat or Contractor
            shall be excused by reasons of closing of public highways, changes in operations, strikes or work stoppages,
            weather conditions that make operations unsafe or impractical, Acts of God, or the temporary or permanent cessation
            of business by Haulcat or Contractor.</p>
        <p>14E. Communications. Contractor agrees that Haulcat or its representatives may contact Contractor by email, phone,
            push notifications or SMS (including by use of an automatic telephone dialing system) at the email address, phone
            or phone number Contractor provides, including for marketing purposes. Contractor also agrees and understands
            that he or she cannot receive Delivery Opportunities and thus cannot provide services on the Platform unless
            SMS and push notifications are enabled.</p>
        <p>14F. Conflict of Terms Clause. In case of any inconsistency or conflict between the terms and conditions of this
            Fleet Agreement and those of the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, the terms of this Fleet Agreement shall
            govern and control.
        </p>
        <p>14G. Privacy Policy. Contractor represents and warrants that he or she has reviewed, understands and agrees to the&nbsp;Haulcat
            Llc Privacy Policy&nbsp;and which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
        <p>14H. Terms of Service. Contractor represents and warrants that he or she has reviewed, understands and agrees to
            the Haulcat Llc Terms of Service&nbsp;and which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
        <p>A copy of this Agreement can be found at Haulcat Llc.com/legal/agreement.</p>

            Provision in Section 11, subject to my right to opt out of said Mutual Arbitration Provision, as described above.</p>
