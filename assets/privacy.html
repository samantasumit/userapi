        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location Information When Using the App. In order to facilitate on-demand deliveries, we need to know where Customers

                app as well as when you place an order, to help determine the appropriate delivery address. We continuously
                collect location information from Couriers who are &ldquo;on duty,&rdquo; in order to assist Couriers in
                finding available deliveries, allow Customers to track deliveries, and other similar purposes. We also use
                location information for analytics purposes.</li>

                mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, unique device identifiers, and, if you register
                with your Facebook account, your Facebook identifier.</li>
