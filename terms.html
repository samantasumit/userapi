        <p class="p4">
            <strong>3. Scope of License</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">The App is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this license. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; reserves
            all rights not expressly granted to you. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;
            hereby grants you a personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use the App on compatible devices
            that you own or control, solely for your non-commercial use.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="p2">You may not modify, alter, reproduce, distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used
            by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the App.
            If you breach these license restrictions, or otherwise exceed the scope of the license granted in these Terms,
            you may be subject to prosecution and legal damages, as well as liability for infringement of intellectual property
            rights. These Terms will govern any updates provided to you by &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; that replace and/or supplement
            the original App, unless the upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license
            will govern.</p>
        <p class="p4">
            <strong>4. Payment Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.1. General Payment Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p3">You understand that the prices for menu items displayed through the Service may differ from the prices offered or
            published by merchants for the same menu items and/or from prices available at other third-party websites and
            that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the menu items are sold. Please note that in some cases,
            the estimated pricing published through the Service at time of checkout may differ from the prevailing pricing;
            for instance, a merchant may charge more for some items than is estimated. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; reserves the
            right to determine final prevailing pricing of all items ordered through the Service. In cases in which prevailing
            pricing is different than the estimated pricing, the fees you are ultimately charged may be different than the
            estimate. You acknowledge and agree to pay the prevailing pricing and fees. Please visit our&nbsp;
            <span class="s1">Help Center</span>&nbsp;to learn more about how items are priced. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; has no obligation to
            itemize its costs, profits or margins when publishing prices on the Site or in the App and reserves the right
            to change such prices at any time, at its discretion. You are liable for all transaction taxes on the Services
            provided under this Agreement (other than taxes based on &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;&rsquo; income).</p>
        <p class="p3">Certain features of the Service, including placing orders, may require you to pay fees. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; may
            change, or add, fees for our Service at any time as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business. You will
            have an opportunity to review and accept an estimate of the fees that you will be charged, as applicable. The
            final fees may differ from the estimate, which may be the result of any requested substitutions or the ultimate
            prevailing price of the items (discussed above). In some cases we may not be able to provide an estimate of the
            fees, such as when the merchandise cost is unknown or we are otherwise unable to predict fees. In all cases,
            you acknowledge and accept that a fee will be charged and you agree to pay said fee. We encourage you to check
            our Site or visit our&nbsp;
            <span class="s1">Help Center</span>&nbsp;periodically to learn more about how we charge for the Service.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase or as otherwise specified
            by you in your account information.</p>
        <p class="p2">Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, except as expressly provided in Section 4.2, and will be quoted
            in the local currency of the location where the order is being delivered. Except as expressly provided in Section
            4.2, &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them, in each case
            in &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; sole discretion and regardless of your decision to terminate your usage, our decision
            to terminate your usage, and/or any disruption caused to our Service for any reason whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;, in its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different
            rates to any of our customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever
            on your use of the Service or fees charged to you. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; reserves its right to expire or modify
            any promotion at any time.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.2. Subscription Service</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; Unlimited is offered as a monthly or yearly pre-paid subscription on a per account basis.</p>
        <p class="p2">If you sign up for the monthly subscription service, you will be charged your first monthly subscription fee on the
            date you purchase your subscription. Your subscription will automatically continue on a monthly basis, and you
            will continue to be charged on a monthly basis at the then-current price, until you cancel your subscription
            or we terminate it. If you sign up for the yearly subscription service, you will be charged your first upfront,
            non-refundable (except as described below) yearly subscription fee on the date you purchase your subscription.
            Your subscription will automatically continue on a yearly basis at the then-current price, and you will continue
            to be charged on a yearly basis, until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You can find your monthly
            and/or yearly subscription billing date in your settings within the App.</p>
        <p class="p3">We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. For information
            on the monthly and yearly subscription fees and terms, please visit our&nbsp;
            <span class="s1">Help Center</span>.</p>
        <p class="p2">You may cancel your subscription service at any time in your account settings or by contacting us via our Help Center.
            You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fees to
            your account. However, if you cancel a pre-paid yearly or monthly subscription, you will not receive any refund.
            If you cancel your monthly or yearly subscription, you will be able to use your Unlimited services for the remainder
            of the your pre-paid subscription term.</p>
        <p class="p2">We may terminate your subscription for &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; Unlimited at our discretion and without any notice.
            If we cancel your yearly subscription for &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; Unlimited, we will give you a prorated refund
            based on the amount of time remaining in your pre-paid subscription; provided, however, that &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;
            will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine,
            in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service violates these Terms or has harmed another
            user.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.3. Payment Authorization</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">You authorize &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; to charge all sums for orders that you make and services you select to the payment
            method designated in your account. When you order on &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;, a temporary pre-authorization hold
            is placed on your designated payment method to verify that the card is valid and has funds available for your
            intended purchase. The amount of this pre-authorization hold may be greater or less than the order total quoted
            at checkout. However, you will only be charged the final order total once your order is registered as complete
            within the &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; system, which generally occurs between 24-48 business hours after you receive
            your order. In the event that the pre-authorization is greater than the final amount, the difference will be
            returned to you after your order is completed or cancelled, which may take up to 5 business days depending on
            your bank.</p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; also places an initial temporary pre-authorization hold on each new payment method you add
            to your account.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; reserves the right to request additional information from you if we have reason to believe,
            in our sole discretion, that a payment method may be fraudulent.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.4. Delinquent Accounts</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p3">If payment for purchases on your account is delinquent, your account information may be sent to a collection agency
            / debt collector and you may be subject to a collection action, and payment of collection related fees and costs.
            If you have questions regarding an outstanding balance on your account, please contact us via our&nbsp;
            <span class="s1">Help Center</span>.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.5. Customer Not Available</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; reserves the right to charge a customer the full order amount if that customer is not at the
            designated delivery location when the courier arrives to complete the delivery.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.6 Cancelled Orders</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">If you cancel your &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; order you may be charged depending on what stage the order was in when you
            cancelled. If you cancel a delivery after it has been accepted but is not yet being prepared by the merchant,
            you will not be charged a cancellation fee. If you cancel a delivery after a merchant has started preparing your
            order, you will be charged the price of the items, including applicable taxes, plus a cancellation fee of up
            to $4. If you cancel a delivery after it is out for delivery, you will be charged the full price of the order.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>4.7 Returned Items</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">If an item has to be returned for any reason, you may be subject to a non-refundable $15 return/restocking fee. For
            alcohol items, the courier reserves the right to refuse delivery and return the item(s) if the name on your ID
            does not match the name on your order, if you are not at least twenty-one (21) years old ("Legal Age"), if you
            cannot provide valid government-issued photo ID that you are Legal Age, or if you are visibly intoxicated.</p>
        <p class="p4">
            <strong>5. Third-Party Interactions</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>5.1. Third-Party Providers</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">During use of the Service, you may purchase goods and services from third-party merchants through the Service. Any
            such activity, and any disputes, terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with that activity,
            is solely between you and the applicable third party. &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; and its licensors shall have no liability,
            obligation or responsibility for any purchase or transaction between you and any third-party provider. In no
            event shall &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; or its licensors be responsible for any content, products, services or other
            materials on or available from third-party sites or third-party providers. Certain third-party providers of goods
            and/or services may require your agreement to additional or different terms and conditions prior to your use
            of or access to such goods or services, and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; disclaims any and all responsibility or liability
            arising from such agreements between you and a third party.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>5.2. Couriers</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">You may engage third-party Couriers through the Service to provide delivery services to you and may interact with
            those Couriers. Any interactions or disputes between you and a Courier are solely between you and that Courier.
            &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; and its licensors shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility for any interaction
            between you and any Courier.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.1. Disputes</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">&lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties
            as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions,
            disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, any Courier or other third party. Disputes
            between a user and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; are subject to this Section 17.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.2. Generally</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; in the most expedient and cost effective
            manner, you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be
            resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
            arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject
            to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our
            agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms,
            whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless
            of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.</p>
        <p class="p2">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND &lsquo;HAULCAT&rsquo; ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT
            TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.3. Exceptions</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed
            to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to:</p>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li2">Bring an individual action in small claims court;</li>
            <li class="li2">Pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available;</li>
            <li class="li2">Seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or</li>
            <li class="li2">To file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.4. Arbitrator</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p3">Any arbitration between you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures
            and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration
            Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing
            forms are available online at&nbsp;

        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.5. Notice Process</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified
            mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic
            mail ("Notice").

        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li2">Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and</li>
            <li class="li2">Set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand")</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p2">We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within
            30 days after the Notice is received, you or &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; may commence an arbitration proceeding. During
            the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; must not be disclosed
            to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>
        <p class="p2">If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; will pay you the highest
            of the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li2">The amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any;</li>
            <li class="li2">The last written settlement amount offered by &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; in settlement of the dispute prior to the
                arbitrator&rsquo;s award; or</li>
            <li class="li2">$1,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.6. Fees</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; will reimburse you for your payment
            of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be
            decided by the AAA Rules.</p>
        <p class="p2">Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but
            if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted:</p>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li2">Solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;</li>
            <li class="li2">Through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or</li>
            <li class="li2">By an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p2">If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or
            brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
            then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;
            for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless
            of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient
            to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>
        <p class="p2">The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any
            time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling
            on the merits.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.7. No Class Actions</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">YOU AND &lsquo;HAULCAT&rsquo; AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
            AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
        <p class="p2">Further, unless both you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
            one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.8. Modifications</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">If &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;&rsquo;
            address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;&rsquo;
            address for Notice, in which case your account with &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; will be immediately terminated and
            this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            <strong>17.9. Enforceability</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">If Section 17.7 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable,
            then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive
            jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
        <p class="p4">
            <strong>18. Modification of these Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">We reserve the right to update or modify the Terms at any time without prior notice, and such changes will be effective
            immediately upon being posted through the Service, except as set forth below. These Terms identify the date of
            last update. Your use of the Service following any such change constitutes your agreement to be bound by the
            modified Terms of Service. In the case of material changes to these Terms, we will make reasonable efforts to
            notify you of the change, such as through sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an
            account, through a pop-up window on the Service, or other similar mechanism.</p>
        <p class="p2">Material changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of:</p>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li2">Your first use of the Service with actual notice of such change, or</li>
            <li class="li2">30 days from posting of such change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p2">Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time
            the dispute arose. We encourage you to review these Terms frequently to stay informed of the latest modifications.</p>
        <p class="p4">

            <strong>20. General</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. If
            a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; agree to submit to
            the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County,
            California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the Service from our offices in California,
            and we make no representation that materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in
            other locations. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;
            or any third-party provider as a result of the Terms or use of the Service.</p>
        <p class="p2">If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the
            remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. The failure of &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo;
            to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
            unless acknowledged and agreed to by &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; in writing.</p>
        <p class="p2">This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between you and &lsquo;Haulcat&rsquo; and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
            negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter
            contained in these Terms.</p>
